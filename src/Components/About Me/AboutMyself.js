      <h4>Hello</h4>
      <p>
        I'm a full stack web developer. I decided to dedicate my time learning
        to code on November 2020 and I've been doing it since then. The way I
        approach learning is to at least study or practice an hour daily before
        going to my full time job and 5-7 hours on weekends. I wish I can grow
        in this career getting better everyday in a work environment where I can
        fully immerse myself in real world scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from coding the thing I like the most is Reading. I love to read
        and I read a book almost every week.
